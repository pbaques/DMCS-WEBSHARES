# DMCS-WEBSHARES
A webshare is a shared virtual space made up of web pages that can be edited and interlinked. Webshare participants with editing capability can edit existing pages and create new ones. Every page can be viewed by every viewing participant and edited and commented on by participants with editorial privileges.
I wish to turn this idea into my DMCS project. The website I will code will showcase and promote the use of webshares.
